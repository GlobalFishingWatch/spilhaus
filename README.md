Plot vessel presence with the Spilhaus projection.

See [notebooks/PlotPresence.ipynb](notebooks/PlotPresence.ipynb) 
for an example of downloading some data and plotting it. This is only
one year of data instead of several for the plot above and is plotting at lower resolution, so it
won't be quite as pretty.
